              The National Committee faced a pressing issue: they needed a
              digital solution that would give committee members quick and
              reliable access to real-time data on buildings, including those
              under construction, with respect to insurance status. The main
              challenges were:

            <p className="text-[20px] md:text-2xl text-[#CDCDCD] ">
              <strong>Real-Time Data:</strong> Accessing up-to-date insurance

            <p className="text-[20px] md:text-2xl text-[#CDCDCD] ">
              <strong> Geographic Complexity:</strong> The need to consider
              geographic distinctions and zoning in order to understand building
              coverage in different areas.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[20px] md:text-2xl text-[#CDCDCD] ">
              <strong> Compliance Tracking:</strong> Verifying insurance status

            </p>
            <p className="text-[20px] md:text-2xl text-[#CDCDCD] ">
              With only one week to develop a solution, it was clear that
              efficiency, clarity, and real-time data were key priorities.

                Working within a tight deadline, I collaborated closely with the
                tech team to brainstorm and identify the key metrics that would
                be most valuable for the committee members. These included:

              <p className="text-[20px] md:text-2xl text-[#CDCDCD] ">
                <strong> • Total Number of Buildings</strong>

              Introducing Geographic Relevance: Dynamic Map Integration

            <p className="text-[20px] md:text-2xl text-[#CDCDCD] ">
              To add another layer of functionality, we introduced a dynamic map
              as a central feature of the dashboard. This map provides:
            </p>

            <p className="text-[20px] md:text-2xl text-[#CDCDCD] ">
              This map was designed to give the committee members a
              comprehensive, visual representation of insurance coverage across
              Nigeria, helping them make informed decisions.

              Enhancing User Interaction: Verifying and Regularizing Building

            </p>
            <p className="text-[20px] md:text-2xl text-[#CDCDCD] ">
              Beyond visualizing data, we designed a feature that allowed
              committee members to:
            </p>
            <p className="text-[20px] md:text-2xl text-[#CDCDCD] ">
              <strong>• Verify Insurance Status:</strong> Users can quickly
              check the insurance status of buildings using a unique identifier
              for each building.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[20px] md:text-2xl text-[#CDCDCD] ">
              <strong>• Regularize Coverage:</strong> For buildings under
              construction, committee members can facilitate the process of
              verifying and regularizing insurance to ensure compliance.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[20px] md:text-2xl text-[#CDCDCD] ">
              This functionality ensures that even new buildings, which may not
              yet be fully constructed, are not left out of the system and can
              be easily tracked for compliance.

              Though I was the sole designer on the project, this experience
              reinforced the importance of teamwork. The success of the
              dashboard was not only due to my design work but also the input
              and expertise from other team members. It was a reminder that
              collaboration, even when time is tight, plays a crucial role in
              the effectiveness of any solution.

              A surprising moment of support came when a designer friend shared
              a highly useful resource with me that helped expedite the design
              process. I casually mentioned the challenge I was facing, and he
              unexpectedly came through with exactly what I needed. This taught
              me the value of being open about challenges with peers—often, a
              solution comes from the most unexpected sources.

              This project, completed in just one week, demonstrates how
              collaboration, user-focused design, and quick thinking can lead to
              impactful solutions even under pressure. The final product—a
              dynamic, user-friendly dashboard—was successfully presented to the
              committee, where it received positive feedback for further review
              and implementation.
