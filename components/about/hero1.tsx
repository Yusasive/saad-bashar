            In the beautiful city of Lagos, Nigeria, my design journey started
            when my curiosity was sparked while seeing texts remixed with
            pictures on facebook in my early teens. Then, I picked up picasa
            (now Google Photos) which happened to be the closest software I
            believed I could use to make such designs. If this was a book,
            consider this part as the preface.

            A decade down the line, I am nurturing an interesting career in
            design, cracking puzzles, pixelating possibilities, and crafting
            creative chaos.
